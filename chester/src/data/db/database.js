The idea behind the application is to help connect animals who were adopted during the pandemic the opportunity to connect and play with other animals in your area. Due to the pandemic, many animals weren't afforded the opportunity to socialize, so we thought this would be a fun way to help the transition for the animal, as well as help the owner make friends!
